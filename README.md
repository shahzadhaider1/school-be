# Go Fiber CRUD Backend with GORM and PostgreSQL

This repository contains a simple backend application built with **Go**, **Fiber**, **GORM**, and **PostgreSQL**. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and serves as a starting point for understanding how to integrate these technologies into a Go-based web application.

## Technologies Used
- **Go**: Programming language used for building the backend.
- **Fiber**: A fast and lightweight web framework for Go.
- **GORM**: ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library for Go to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database system.

## Features
- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- RESTful API structure.
- Interaction with PostgreSQL using GORM for database management.
- Simple error handling and validation.
